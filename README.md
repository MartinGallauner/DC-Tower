# DC-Tower
My implementation of the DC Tower Coding Challenge for IBM.

## Procedure 
The best way to run this project is to run the unit tests.


#Update 09/2019:
In November 2018 I applied for an entry level developer job at IBM (CIC) in Vienna.
This coding challenge was part of the interviewing process and this was my result I sent in back then.
